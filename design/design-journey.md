# Group Project: Design Journey

**You are encouraged to work ahead on everything on this project.** (Though we suggest you hold back on the interactivity until Project 3.) **Each section is required for a specific milestone. You are required to have these sections completed before that milestone's deadline.**

**Be clear and concise in your writing.** Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.

- She really likes the content and design for the website for E Cornell.


## Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

- Our client Yue Li is a Research Associate in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at Cornell University. And fulfills the clients rules because of the following:
  1. Our client is not one of the members of our group.
  2. None of us are associated with the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment.
  3. None of use knew who this client was before hand, and therefore have no close personal relationship with said client.


## Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants. Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> NOTE: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page.) Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

The existing one has too many contents, and she wants us to just focus on the original learning page in the existing website and make a website covering four aspects of it: basic introduction, course description, resources, and a gallery of outcomes.
The purpose of the website is 1. engage the public and share resources about nature, and 2. Have audience register and take the course
Site link: https://www.civicecology.org/


## Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> Your project should be ambitious, but not too large. A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big. Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

1. landing page
2. one specific course (urban) to redesign
3. resources page such as lesson page
4. gallery page like students social media page
	All four of the members will be making one page from above. Each page contains a considerable amount of information but does not get too specific.


## Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

They want a website that appeals to both students and teachers (but on separate sections of the website, excluding the home page).
The clients want their website to be more organized in the manner mentioned above.
A website that can keep their user engaged, even if they don’t want to actually join the lab it is advertising.

- Goal A: Register for courses
- Goal B: Download resources (lesson plans, lab journals).
- Goal C: Follow social media (facebook, insta).
