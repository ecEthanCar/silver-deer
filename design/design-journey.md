# Group Project: Design Journey

**You are encouraged to work ahead on everything on this project.** (Though we suggest you hold back on the interactivity until Project 3.) **Each section is required for a specific milestone. You are required to have these sections completed before that milestone's deadline.**

**Be clear and concise in your writing.** Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


# Client (Milestone 1)

## Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.
- Purpose 1: Engage the public. Let them know resources they have
- Purpose 2: Attract people to take course


2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?
- Apply research to teaching → based on cutting edge research

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site? Do you want to keep all the existing content or adjust them?
- Home Page: Principles of the organization (redesign to look more professional and easy to read.
- Specific courses: just a list of courses with videos, descriptions, and enrollment (redesign to look more appealing)
- Statistics page: just to show off what the lab has done (maybe do? Could be incorporated in the home page).
- Resources/Publications: should have a list of projects you can do in the lab. Used by teachers to develop lesson plans, 25 plans (split into two sites).
- Gallery page: for images related to lesson plans. Explore nature and take photos, explain why they relate to nature to you?
- Gathering page: social media posts, etc. (make it more lively).

7. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' sites? Why?
- She really likes the content and design for the website for E Cornell.


## Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

- Our client Yue Li is a Research Associate in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at Cornell University. And fulfills the clients rules because of the following:
  1. Our client is not one of the members of our group.
  2. None of us are associated with the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment.
  3. None of use knew who this client was before hand, and therefore have no close personal relationship with said client.


## Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants. Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> NOTE: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page.) Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

The existing one has too many contents, and she wants us to just focus on the original learning page in the existing website and make a website covering four aspects of it: basic introduction, course description, resources, and a gallery of outcomes.
The purpose of the website is 1. engage the public and share resources about nature, and 2. Have audience register and take the course
Site link: <https://www.civicecology.org/>


## Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> Your project should be ambitious, but not too large. A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big. Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

1. landing page
2. one specific course (urban) to redesign
3. resources page such as lesson page
4. gallery page like students social media page
	All four of the members will be making one page from above. Each page contains a considerable amount of information but does not get too specific.


## Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

They want a website that appeals to both students and teachers (but on separate sections of the website, excluding the home page).
The clients want their website to be more organized in the manner mentioned above.
A website that can keep their user engaged, even if they don’t want to actually join the lab it is advertising.

- Goal A: Register for courses
- Goal B: Download resources (lesson plans, lab journals).
- Goal C: Follow social media (facebook, insta).


## First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from the client meeting.

- Focus on nature education page
- Goal: engage public and share resources and research with general public
- Audience are professionals and educators, teacher, high schoolers, diverse
- Feature newest course at the top
- Possible intro video on landing page
- Include course principles
- Current page is too much → change so that it is easy to read, attract more people
- Redesign course description page
- Attract people to register and check other course registration pages


# Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!

# Site Design/Plan (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience. Be specific and justify why this audience is a cohesive group with regard to your client's site. This audience should not be overly broad nor arbitrarily specific. It should be a cohesive group with similar _goals_.

The site’s audience is a global community of educators, students, and volunteers who are interested in learning more about ecology through the Cornell Civic Ecology lab. They may be interested in learning about ecology for the purpose of teaching others, or for the sake of their own knowledge, or to apply this knowledge to their own research. While the audience is located all over the world, they have the common interest of obtaining ecology knowledge and can do so from the digital courses that the site offers.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project I am (re-)designing a web site for _client's name_. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10-15 minutes. You are free to quit at any time.

1. Tell me about yourself. Where are you from and what do you do for a living (occupation)? (student: what are you interested in majoring in?) You may omit any personal or private information.
2. What is your background in ecology, if any?
  a. What other knowledge did you acquire?
  b. How do you plan on applying this knowledge in the future?
3. Have you taken any online or in-person ecology courses? (No matter the response) Describe your experience.
4. If you’ve registered for an ecology course before (if not ecology, any online course), did you seek out any information beforehand? Where did you seek out this information? What attracted you to register for your most recent course?
5. While taking the actual course, what were your most and least favorite moments in it?
6. After taking the course, was there any information you wish you had known about the course beforehand or information that you weren't able to find?
7. Did you seek out resources outside of the course?
  a. If so, why did you want to do it, and were those resources helpful?
8. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?


**After the interview:** This was really helpful. Thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. Have a great day!


### Interview Notes (Milestone 2)
> Interview at least 4 people from your audience. Take notes and include those notes here. Make sure to include a brief description of each interviewee.

**Interviewee 1:**
Description: Audrey Andres is a Cornell Hotel School student from the Bay Area in California.
Notes: Audrey loves Ecology, and she lived in the ecology house (a dorm)  last year at Cornell where she learned a lot of related knowledge about ecology. She is interested in sustainability and creating sustainable businesses. In her personal life, she has a passion for nature and the outdoors. She wants to work for or create her own company in the future focusing on sustainability and hospitality. Specifically, trying to make a benchmark restaurant that focuses on sustainability, since there is so much waste in the restaurant. With climate change, crewships, hotels and restaurants will have to address all of the waste of energy, food, etc. in their operations. She has not taken any online or in person ecology classes, but she is looking at enrolling in ecology classes at Cornell. She has seeked out ecology classes on Class Roster. For learning online, she likes to learn through videos and practice problems. If it is only through reading, nothing could really be absorbed. Most of her online classes are distributed through Canvas, and her least favorite part of Canvas is that the calendar does not have clear due dates, class times in one place. Her favorite part about Canvas is that Canvas is very convenient and she can use it on both her phone and the computer. She gained ecology knowledge mostly from the Cornell Library database or just by looking online through YouTube videos or webpages. Her purpose of researching ecology is for personal purposes/interests. I also showed her the existing webpage, and she pointed out that it would be helpful to put the courses front and center and have a description of the course.

**Interviewee 3:**

TODO: description
TODO: notes


**Interviewee 4:**

Description: He is a junior at Tufts University majoring in Environmental Science, Architecture, and Studio Art with a concentration in sculpture.

Notes:
- He gained interest in ecology through playing in the gorges and rivers during his childhood.
- His studies at college had helped him gain much more specific information and skills revolving around ecology.
- He plans on applying this knowledge in his artistic pursuits as well as architectural and design pursuits in his future career.
- He has taken both online and in person ecology courses. His experience with online courses has been relatively fine, with the exception of there being a lack of interactivity and fieldwork. Which is not an issue with in person courses, which provide much more hands-on learning opportunities.
- He has looked for course information prior to registering for an ecology course, which he found via friends/professors.
- His major requirements and personal interest in ecology are what attracted him to registering for his current courses.
- His favorite moments in online class were solving a problem and doing some sort of fieldwork. His least favorite moments always stem from poor communication on the part of the professor.
- There wasn’t any additional information he wished he had known after taking an online course.
- He did look for resources outside of this course, since he wanted to learn more about the topics that interest him and learn more about the world around me.
- Question asked by him: Information that was related more specifically to the connection between ecology and other aspects of my life?
