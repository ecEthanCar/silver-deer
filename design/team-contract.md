# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remoce or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    TODO

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    TODO

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    TODO

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    TODO

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)

    TODO

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    TODO

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    TODO

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    TODO

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    TODO


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.
